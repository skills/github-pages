          <p>The <span class="w3-text-white w3-blue">main killer disease</span> that stalk your future are avoidable. It may involve you in a life-style change. This change brings health benefits almost immediately, improving the quality, as well as the length of life</p>
           <p>What we eat doesn’t just affect our waistline—it impacts our brain, mood, and overall well-being. Research shows that a well-balanced diet can boost energy, enhance mental clarity, and reduce the risk of mood disorders like anxiety and depression. On the flip side, poor nutrition can contribute to fatigue, stress, and even long-term cognitive decline.</p>
          <p>YOUR HEALTH IN YOUR HANDS is about the life-style that makes you feel better than you ever felt before - physically, emotionally, mentally - <em>and</em> postpones your funeral!</p>

                                <h4 class="w3-text-white w3-orange w3-center">THE POWERFUL LINK BETWEEN NUTRITION AND MENTAL HEALTH</h4>
                                  <p>1.<span class="w3-text-white w3-blue"> The Gut-Brain Connection: Your Second Brain</span> - Have you ever felt “butterflies” in your stomach when nervous? That’s because the gut and brain are deeply connected through the gut-brain axis. Scientists now refer to the gut as the "second brain" because it produces about 90% of the body’s serotonin, a neurotransmitter that regulates mood, sleep, and emotions.</p>
                                  <p><span class="w3-text-white w3-gray">How to Strengthen Your Gut for Mental Wellness:</span></p>
                                  <p><span class="w3-text-black">Reduce Processed Foods:</span>- Artificial additives and excess sugar disrupt gut health and mood stability.</p>
                              <p><span class="w3-text-black">Add Prebiotic Foods:</span> Garlic, onions, bananas, and oats feed beneficial gut bacteria.</p>
                              <p><span class="w3-text-black">Eat Probiotic-Rich Foods:</span> Yogurt, kimchi, kefir, and sauerkraut help balance gut bacteria.</p>
                              <p>2.<span class="w3-text-white w3-blue"> Nutrients That Fuel the Brain</span> - Certain nutrients play a crucial role in maintaining brain function and emotional balance:</p>
                              <p><span class="w3-text-black">Omega-3 Fatty Acids:</span> Found in fatty fish, walnuts, and flaxseeds, these healthy fats reduce brain inflammation and enhance cognitive function. Research suggests they may help combat depression.</p>
                              <p><span class="w3-text-black">B Vitamins (B12 & Folate):</span> Deficiencies in these vitamins are linked to low energy and mood disorders. Get them from leafy greens, eggs, and beans.</p>
                              <p><span class="w3-text-black">Magnesium:</span> A natural stress-reliever found in spinach, almonds, and dark chocolate. It helps calm the nervous system.</p>
                              <p><span class="w3-text-black">Vitamin D:</span> The "sunshine vitamin" supports serotonin production. Sun exposure and fatty fish are great sources.</p>
                              <p>3.<span class="w3-text-white w3-blue"> How Poor Nutrition Contributes to Mental Health Issues</span></p>
                              <p>Diets high in processed foods, refined sugar, and unhealthy fats have been linked to an increased risk of depression and anxiety. A landmark study published in the American Journal of Psychiatry found that individuals who consumed a high-processed diet were more likely to experience mood disorders than those who followed a whole-food, Mediterranean-style diet.</p>
                              <p><span  class="w3-text-white w3-gray">Why Processed Foods Harm Mental Health:</span></p>
                              <p>Cause blood sugar spikes and crashes, leading to mood swings and fatigue.</p>
                              <p>Increase inflammation, which has been linked to depression.</p>
                              <p>Disrupt gut bacteria, affecting serotonin production.</p>
                              <p>4.<span class="w3-text-white w3-blue"> Hydration, Sleep & Mental Clarity</span></p>
                              <p>Dehydration can cause brain fog, irritability, and difficulty concentrating. Aim for at least 8 glasses of water per day.</p>
                              <p>Good nutrition supports quality sleep, and lack of sleep increases stress and anxiety. Foods like almonds and herbal teas can promote relaxation.</p>
                              <p>5.<span class="w3-text-white w3-blue"> Practical Steps for Better Nutrition & Mental Health</span> - <br>
                               <span class="w3-text-red">✔</span> Eat Whole, Nutrient-Dense Foods: Focus on real, unprocessed foods.<br>
                               <span class="w3-text-red"> ✔</span> Limit Sugar & Junk Food: They offer short-term pleasure but long-term harm.<br>
                                <span class="w3-text-red">✔</span> Prioritize Gut Health: Probiotics, fiber, and fermented foods are key.<br>
                                <span class="w3-text-red">✔</span> Stay Hydrated: Drink water consistently throughout the day.<br>

                              <h3><span class="w3-text-white w3-black">FINAL THOUGHTS</span></h3>
                              <p>The saying "you are what you eat" is especially true when it comes to mental health. By nourishing your body with the right foods, you’re also nourishing your mind. Small, intentional dietary changes can have a profound impact on mood, energy, and long-term mental resilience.</p>

THE supreme prayer of my 
heart is not to be learned, 
rich, famous, powerful, or 
“*good,’’ but simply to be 
radiant. I desire to radiate 
health, cheerfulness, calm 
courage and good will 4 
I wish to live without hate, 
whim, jealousy, envy, fear. 
I wish to be simple, honest, frank, natural, 
clean in mind and clean in body, unaffected— 
ready to say ‘‘I do not know,’’ if it be so, and 
to meet all men on an absolute equality—to 
face any obstacle and meet every difficulty 
unabashed and unafraid. 
I wish others to live their lives, too—up to 
their highest, fullest and best. To that end I 
pray that I may never meddle, interfere, 
dictate, give advice that is not wanted, or 
assist when my services are not needed. If I 
can help people, I ’ll do it by giving them a 
chance to help themselves; and if I can uplift 
or 
inspire, let it be by example, inference, 
and suggestion, rather than by injunction and 
dictation. @ That is to say, I desire to be 
radiant—to radiate life. </p>

<p class="text-meduim">BY exercise of its faculties  the spirit grows, just as a 
muscle grows span thru 
continued use. Expression 
is necessary 4 Life is 
expression, and repression 
is stagnation—death. 
Yet, there can be night 
and wrong expression. If 
2 man permits his life to run riot and only the 
animal side of his nature is allowed to express 
itself, he is repressing his highest and best, and 
the qualities not used atrophy and die. 
Men are punished by their sins, not for them. 
Sensuality, gluttony, and the life of license 
repress the life of the spirit, and the soul never 
blossoms; and this is what it is to lose one’s 
soul. All adown the centuries thinking men 
have noted these truths, and again and again 
we find individuals forsaking in horror the life 
of the senses and devoting themselves to the 
life of the spirit. This question of expression 
through the spirit, or through the senses— 
through soul or body—has been the pivotal 
point of all philosophy and the inspiration of 
all religion. ...</p>

                               <p>Love, Life & Work is a timeless book that offers deep insights into what it means to live a fulfilling and authentic life. Elbert Hubbard’s essays encourage readers to embrace love,

                               <p>His philosophy is simple yet profound: happiness comes not from wealth or status,
                                 but from self-expression, meaningful work, and love. This book serves as an inspiring guide for anyone seeking to live with more purpose and joy.</p>

# GitHub Pages

_Create a site or blog from your GitHub repositories with GitHub Pages._

</header>

<!--
  <<< Author notes: Course start >>>
  Include start button, a note about Actions minutes,
  and tell the learner why they should take the course.
-->

## Welcome

With GitHub Pages, you can host project blogs, documentation, resumes, portfolios, or any other static content you'd like. Your GitHub repository can easily become its own website. In this course, we'll show you how to set up your own site or blog using GitHub Pages.

- **Who is this for**: Beginners, students, project maintainers, small businesses.
- **What you'll learn**: How to build a GitHub Pages site.
- **What you'll build**: We'll build a simple GitHub Pages site with a blog. We'll use [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), a static site generator.
- **Prerequisites**: If you need to learn about branches, commits, and pull requests, take [Introduction to GitHub](https://github.com/skills/introduction-to-github) first.
- **How long**: This course takes less than one hour to complete.

In this course, you will:

1. Enable GitHub Pages
2. Configure your site
3. Customize your home page
4. Create a blog post
5. Merge your pull request

### How to start this course

<!-- For start course, run in JavaScript:
'https://github.com/new?' + new URLSearchParams({
  template_owner: 'skills',
  template_name: 'github-pages',
  owner: '@me',
  name: 'skills-github-pages',
  description: 'My clone repository',
  visibility: 'public',
}).toString()
-->

[![start-course](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1221423/235727646-4a590299-ffe5-480d-8cd5-8194ea184546.svg)](https://github.com/new?template_owner=skills&template_name=github-pages&owner=%40me&name=skills-github-pages&description=My+clone+repository&visibility=public)

1. Right-click **Start course** and open the link in a new tab.
2. In the new tab, most of the prompts will automatically fill in for you.
   - For owner, choose your personal account or an organization to host the repository.
   - We recommend creating a public repository, as private repositories will [use Actions minutes](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-github-actions/about-billing-for-github-actions).
   - Scroll down and click the **Create repository** button at the bottom of the form.
3. After your new repository is created, wait about 20 seconds, then refresh the page. Follow the step-by-step instructions in the new repository's README.
