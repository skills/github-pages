# How to Get Your Blog URL and Share on LinkedIn

## Step 1: Enable GitHub Pages

1. **Go to your GitHub repository** (the one containing your blog)
2. **Click on "Settings"** (in the repository, not your account settings)
3. **Scroll down to "Pages"** in the left sidebar
4. **Under "Source"**, select "Deploy from a branch"
5. **Choose "main" branch** and "/ (root)" folder
6. **Click "Save"**

## Step 2: Get Your Blog URL

After enabling GitHub Pages, your blog will be available at:

```
https://yourusername.github.io/repository-name
```

For example:
- If your GitHub username is `johndoe`
- And your repository name is `github-pages`
- Your blog URL will be: `https://johndoe.github.io/github-pages`

## Step 3: Custom Domain (Optional)

If you want a custom domain like `yourdomain.com`:

1. **Buy a domain** from any domain registrar (GoDaddy, Namecheap, etc.)
2. **In your GitHub repository**, create a file named `CNAME` in the root directory
3. **Add your domain** to the CNAME file (just the domain, no https://)
4. **Configure DNS** at your domain registrar:
   - Add a CNAME record pointing to `yourusername.github.io`
5. **Wait for DNS propagation** (can take up to 24 hours)

## Step 4: Share on LinkedIn

Once your site is live:

1. **Copy your blog URL**
2. **Go to LinkedIn**
3. **Create a new post**
4. **Paste your blog URL** - LinkedIn will automatically generate a preview
5. **Add your message**, for example:

```
